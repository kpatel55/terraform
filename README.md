# Terraform Examples

This directory contains a set of examples for using various cloud services with Terraform.

To run any example, clone the repository and run `terraform apply` within the example's own directory.

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpatel55/terraform.git
cd alarms-demo
terraform apply
```

To delete resources, run `terraform destroy` in the same directory you ran `terraform apply`.
